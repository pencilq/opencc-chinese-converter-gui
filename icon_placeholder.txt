# This is a placeholder for icon.ico
# For a real icon file, you should create or download a proper .ico file
# You can use online tools like:
# - https://www.icoconverter.com/
# - https://convertio.co/png-ico/
# 
# Or create one using tools like GIMP, Paint.NET, or Adobe Illustrator
# 
# The icon should be 256x256 pixels or include multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256)
# and represent the application - perhaps a combination of Chinese characters and conversion arrows
#
# For now, PyInstaller will use a default icon if this file is missing.
